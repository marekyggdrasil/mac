# MAC!

I am MAC!, or Mina Arbitrated Contracts if you want to be formal. I am an [zkApp](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/zkapps/how-zkapps-work) that makes zkApps (yes, really!).

The best part is you do not even need to know how to code! Go visit https://mac.sqrtxx.com/ to read more about me and try me!

## Setup

Install the dependencies for the smart contract, from the root of this repo run

```sh
cd contracts
```

then install the dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

and build it

```sh
npm run build
```

now to prepare the UI of the MAC! app, from same directory run

```sh
cd ../ui
```

to change the UI directory, now install the dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

and run the app locally

```sh
npm run dev
```
